It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.\n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Harry Potter thinks he is an ordinary boy - until he is rescued by an owl, taken to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, learns to play Quidditch and does battle in a deadly duel.

Jane Austen called this brilliant work \"her own darling child\" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, \"as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print.\" The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780679783268\n4 Discovered in the attic in which she spent the last years of her life, Anne Frank’s remarkable diary has become a world classic—a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spirit. In 1942, with the Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, the Franks and another family lived cloistered in the “Secret Annexe” of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and surprisingly humorous, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.--back cover\n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Librarian's note: There is an Alternate Cover Edition for this edition of this book here.A farm is taken over by its overworked, mistreated animals. With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they set out to create a paradise of progress, justice, and equality. Thus the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned –a razor-edged fairy tale for grown-ups that records the evolution from revolution against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible. When Animal Farm was first published, Stalinist Russia was seen as its target. Today it is devastatingly clear that wherever and whenever freedom is attacked, under whatever banner, the cutting clarity and savage comedy of George Orwell’s masterpiece have a meaning and message still ferociously fresh.\n6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         A pilot stranded in the desert awakes one morning to see, standing before him, the most extraordinary little fellow. \"Please,\" asks the stranger, \"draw me a sheep.\" And the pilot realizes that when life's events are too difficult to understand, there is no choice but to succumb to their mysteries.

It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.\n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Harry Potter thinks he is an ordinary boy - until he is rescued by an owl, taken to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, learns to play Quidditch and does battle in a deadly duel.

Jane Austen called this brilliant work \"her own darling child\" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, \"as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print.\" The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780679783268\n4 Discovered in the attic in which she spent the last years of her life, Anne Frank’s remarkable diary has become a world classic—a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spirit. In 1942, with the Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, the Franks and another family lived cloistered in the “Secret Annexe” of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and surprisingly humorous, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.--back cover\n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Librarian's note: There is an Alternate Cover Edition for this edition of this book here.A farm is taken over by its overworked, mistreated animals. With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they set out to create a paradise of progress, justice, and equality. Thus the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned –a razor-edged fairy tale for grown-ups that records the evolution from revolution against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible. When Animal Farm was first published, Stalinist Russia was seen as its target. Today it is devastatingly clear that wherever and whenever freedom is attacked, under whatever banner, the cutting clarity and savage comedy of George Orwell’s masterpiece have a meaning and message still ferociously fresh.\n6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         A pilot stranded in the desert awakes one morning to see, standing before him, the most extraordinary little fellow. \"Please,\" asks the stranger, \"draw me a sheep.\" And the pilot realizes that when life's events are too difficult to understand, there is no choice but to succumb to their mysteries. He pulls out pencil and paper... And thus begins this wise and enchanting fable that, in teaching the secret of what is really important in life, has changed forever the world for its readers.Few stories are as widely read and as universally cherished by children and adults alike as The Little Prince, presented here in a stunning new translation with carefully restored artwork.

The graph itself can have such attributes too (e.g. a name, which will show in summary). In a sense, every graph, vertex and edge can be used as an R namespace to store and retrieve these attributes.\nTo demonstrate the use of attributes, let us create a simple social network:\n\n\nCode\ng &lt;- make_graph(~ Alice-Bob:Claire:Frank, Claire-Alice:Dennis:Frank:Esther,\n                George-Dennis:Frank, Dennis-Esther)\n\n\nEach vertex represents a person, so we want to store ages, genders and types of connection between two people (is_formal refers to whether a connection between one person or another is formal or informal, i.e. colleagues or friends).

This assigns an attribute to all vertices/edges at once. Another way to generate our social network is with the use of set_vertex_attr and set_edge_attr and the operator %\\&gt;%:\n\n\nCode\ng &lt;- make_graph(~ Alice-Bob:Claire:Frank, Claire-Alice:Dennis:Frank:Esther,\n                George-Dennis:Frank, Dennis-Esther) %&gt;%\n  set_vertex_attr(\"age\", value = c(25, 31, 18, 23, 47, 22, 50)) %&gt;%\n  set_vertex_attr(\"gender\", value = c(\"f\", \"m\", \"f\", \"m\", \"m\", \"f\", \"m\")) %&gt;%\n  set_edge_attr(\"is_formal\", value = c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE))\nsummary(g)\n\n\nTo assign or modify an attribute for a single vertex/edge:\n\n\nCode\nE(g)$is_formal\n\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nCode\nE(g)$is_formal[1] &lt;- TRUE\nE(g)$is_formal\n\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nAttribute values can be set to any R object, but note that storing the graph in some file formats might result in the loss of complex attribute values. Vertices, edges and the graph itself can all be used to set attributes, e.g. to add a date to the graph:\n\n\nCode\ng$date &lt;- c(\"2022-02-11\")\ngraph_attr(g, \"date\")\n\n\n[1] \"2022-02-11\"\n\n\nTo retrieve attributes, you can also use graph_attr, vertex_attr, and edge_attr. To find the ID of a vertex you can use the function match:\n\n\nCode\nmatch(c(\"George\"), V(g)$name)\n\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nTo assign attributes to a subset of vertices or edges, you can use:\n\n\nCode\nV(g)$name[1:3] &lt;- c(\"Alejandra\", \"Bruno\", \"Carmina\")\nV(g)\n\n\n+ 7/7 vertices, named, from 2d5397d:\n[1] Alejandra Bruno     Carmina   Frank     Dennis    Esther    George   \n\n\nTo delete attributes:\n\n\nCode\ng &lt;- delete_vertex_attr(g, \"gender\")\nV(g)$gender\n\n\nNULL\n\n\nIf you want to save a graph in R with all the attributes use the R’s standard function dput function and retrieve it later with dget. You can also just save the R workspace and restore it later."

    "text": "Structural properties of graphs\nigraph provides a large set of functions to calculate various structural properties of graphs. It is beyond the scope of this tutorial to document all of them, hence this section will only introduce a few of them for illustrative purposes. We will work on the small social network constructed in the previous section.\nPerhaps the simplest property one can think of is the degree. The degree of a vertex equals the number of edges adjacent to it. In case of directed networks, we can also define in-degree (the number of edges pointing towards the vertex) and out-degree (the number of edges originating from the vertex). igraph is able to calculate all of them using a simple syntax:\n\n\nCode\ndegree(g)\n\n\nAlejandra     Bruno   Carmina     Frank    Dennis    Esther    George \n        3         1         4         3         3         2         2 \n\n\nIf the graph was directed, we would have been able to calculate the in- and out-degrees separately using degree(mode=\"in\") and degree(mode=\"out\"). You can also pass a single vertex ID or a list of vertex IDs to degree if you want to calculate the degrees for only a subset of vertices:\n\n\nCode\ndegree(g, 7)\n\n\nGeorge \n     2 \n\n\n\n\nCode\ndegree(g, v=c(3,4,5))\n\n\nCarmina   Frank  Dennis \n      4       3       3 \n\n\nMost functions that accept vertex IDs also accept vertex names (i.e. the values of the name vertex attribute) as long as the names are unique:\n\n\nCode\ndegree(g, v=c(\"Carmina\", \"Frank\", \"Dennis\"))\n\n\nCarmina   Frank  Dennis \n      4       3       3 \n\n\nIt also works for single vertices:\n\n\nCode\ndegree(g, \"Bruno\")\n\n\nBruno \n    1 \n\n\nA similar syntax is used for most of the structural properties igraph can calculate. For vertex properties, the functions accept a vertex ID, a vertex name, or a list of vertex IDs or names (and if they are omitted, the default is the set of all vertices). For edge properties, the functions accept a single edge ID or a list of edge IDs.\n\nNOTE: For some measures, it does not make sense to calculate them only for a few vertices or edges instead of the whole graph, as it would take the same time anyway. In this case, the functions won’t accept vertex or edge IDs, but you can still restrict the resulting list later using standard operations. One such example is eigenvector centrality (evcent()).\n\nBesides degree, igraph includes built-in routines to calculate many other centrality properties, including vertex and edge betweenness (edge_betweenness) or Google’s PageRank (page_rank) just to name a few. Here we just illustrate edge betweenness:\n\n\nCode\nedge_betweenness(g)\n\n\n[1] 6 6 4 3 4 4 4 2 3\n\n\nNow we can also figure out which connections have the highest betweenness centrality:\n\n\nCode\nebs &lt;- edge_betweenness(g)\nas_edgelist(g)[ebs == max(ebs), ]\n\n\n     [,1]        [,2]     \n[1,] \"Alejandra\" \"Bruno\"  \n[2,] \"Alejandra\" \"Carmina\""

You can do that with the tools presented so far and the which.max function:\n\n\nCode\nwhich.max(degree(g))\n\n\nCarmina \n      3 \n\n\nAnother example would be to select only vertices that have only odd IDs but not even ones, using the V function:\n\n\nCode\ngraph &lt;- graph.full(n=10)\nonly_odd_vertices &lt;- which(V(graph)%%2==1)\nlength(only_odd_vertices)\n\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nOf course, it is possible to select vertices or edges by positional indices:\n\n\nCode\nseq &lt;- V(graph)[2, 3, 7]\nseq\n\n\n+ 3/10 vertices, from a2165ca:\n[1] 2 3 7\n\n\n\n\nCode\nseq &lt;- seq[1, 3]    # filtering an existing vertex set\nseq\n\n\n+ 2/10 vertices, from a2165ca:\n[1] 2 7\n\n\nSelecting a vertex that does not exist results in an error:\n\n\nCode\nseq &lt;- V(graph)[2, 3, 7, \"foo\", 3.5]\n## Error in simple_vs_index(x, ii, na_ok) : Unknown vertex selected\n\n\nAttribute names can also be used as-is within the indexing brackets of V() and E(). This can be combined with R’s ability to use boolean vectors for indexing to obtain very concise and readable expressions to retrieve a subset of the vertex or edge set of a graph. For instance, the following command gives you the names of the individuals younger than 30 years in our social network:\n\n\nCode\nV(g)[age &lt; 30]$name\n\n\n[1] \"Alejandra\" \"Carmina\"   \"Frank\"     \"Esther\"   \n\n\nOf course, &lt; is not the only boolean operator that can be used for this. Other possibilities include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperator\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n==\nThe attribute/property value must be equal to\n\n\n!=\nThe attribute/property value must not be equal to\n\n\n&lt;\nThe attribute/property value must be less than\n\n\n&lt;=\nThe attribute/property value must be less than or equal to\n\n\n&gt;\nThe attribute/property value must be greater than\n\n\n&gt;=\nThe attribute/property value must be greater than or equal to\n\n\n%in%\nThe attribute/property value must be included in\n\n\n\nYou can also create a “not in” operator from %in% using the Negate function:\n\n\nCode\n`%notin%` &lt;- Negate(`%in%`)\n\n\nIf an attribute has the same name as an igraph function, you should be careful as the syntax can become a little confusing. For instance, if there is an attribute named degree that represents the grades of an exam for each person, that should not be confused with the igraph function that computes the degrees of vertices in a network sense:\n\n\nCode\nV(g)$degree &lt;- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"B+\", \"A+\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\")\nV(g)$degree[degree(g) == 3]\n\n\n[1] \"A\"  \"A+\" \"C\" \n\n\n\n\nCode\nV(g)$name[degree(g) == 3]\n\n\n[1] \"Alejandra\" \"Frank\"     \"Dennis\"   \n\n\n\n\nSelecting edges\nEdges can be selected based on attributes just like vertices. As mentioned above, the standard way to get edges is E. Moreover, there are a few special structural properties for selecting edges.\nUsing .from allows you to filter the edge sequence based on the source vertices of the edges. E.g., to select all the edges originating from Carmina (who has vertex index 3):\n\n\nCode\nE(g)[.from(3)]\n\n\n+ 4/9 edges from 2d5397d (vertex names):\n[1] Alejandra--Carmina Carmina  --Frank   Carmina  --Dennis  Carmina  --Esther \n\n\nOf course it also works with vertex names:\n\n\nCode\nE(g)[.from(\"Carmina\")]\n\n\n+ 4/9 edges from 2d5397d (vertex names):\n[1] Alejandra--Carmina Carmina  --Frank   Carmina  --Dennis  Carmina  --Esther \n\n\nUsing .to filters edge sequences based on the target vertices. This is different from .from if the graph is directed, while it gives the same answer for undirected graphs. Using .inc selects only those edges that are incident on a single vertex or at least one of the vertices, irrespectively of the edge directions.\nThe %--% operator can be used to select edges between specific groups of vertices, ignoring edge directions in directed graphs. For instance, the following expression selects all the edges between Carmina (vertex index 3), Dennis (vertex index 5) and Esther (vertex index 6):\n\n\nCode\nE(g) [ 3:5 %--% 5:6 ]\n\n\n+ 3/9 edges from 2d5397d (vertex names):\n[1] Carmina--Dennis Carmina--Esther Dennis --Esther\n\n\nTo make the %--% operator work with names, you can build string vectors containing the names and then use these vectors as operands. For instance, to select all the edges that connect men to women, we can do the following after re-adding the gender attribute that we deleted earlier:\n\n\nCode\nV(g)$gender &lt;- c(\"f\", \"m\", \"f\", \"m\", \"m\", \"f\", \"m\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmen &lt;- V(g)[gender == \"m\"]$name\nmen\n\n\n[1] \"Bruno\"  \"Frank\"  \"Dennis\" \"George\"\n\n\n\n\nCode\nwomen &lt;- V(g)[gender == \"f\"]$name\nwomen\n\n\n[1] \"Alejandra\" \"Carmina\"   \"Esther\"   \n\n\n\n\nCode\nE(g)[men %--% women]\n\n\n+ 5/9 edges from 2d5397d (vertex names):\n[1] Alejandra--Bruno  Alejandra--Frank  Carmina  --Frank  Carmina  --Dennis\n[5] Dennis   --Esther"

    "text": "Layouts and plotting\nA graph is an abstract mathematical object without a specific representation in 2D, 3D or any other geometric space. This means that whenever we want to visualise a graph, we have to find a mapping from vertices to coordinates in two- or three-dimensional space first, preferably in a way that is useful and/or pleasing for the eye. A separate branch of graph theory, namely graph drawing, tries to solve this problem via several graph layout algorithms. igraph implements quite a few layout algorithms and is also able to draw them onto the screen or to any output format that R itself supports.\n\nLayout algorithms\nThe layout functions in igraph always start with layout. The following table summarises them:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod name\nAlgorithm description\n\n\n\n\nlayout_randomly\nPlaces the vertices completely randomly\n\n\nlayout_in_circle\nDeterministic layout that places the vertices on a circle\n\n\nlayout_on_sphere\nDeterministic layout that places the vertices evenly on the surface of a sphere\n\n\nlayout_with_drl\nThe Drl (Distributed Recursive Layout) algorithm for large graphs\n\n\nlayout_with_fr\nFruchterman-Reingold force-directed algorithm\n\n\nlayout_with_kk\nKamada-Kawai force-directed algorithm\n\n\nlayout_with_lgl\nThe LGL (Large Graph Layout) algorithm for large graphs\n\n\nlayout_as_tree\nReingold-Tilford tree layout, useful for (almost) tree-like graphs\n\n\nlayout_nicely\nLayout algorithm that automatically picks one of the other algorithms based on certain properties of the graph\n\n\n\nLayout algorithms can be called directly with a graph as its first argument. They will return a matrix with two columns and as many rows as the number of vertices in the graph; each row will correspond to the position of a single vertex, ordered by vertex IDs. Some algorithms have a 3D variant; in this case they return three columns instead of 2.\n\n\nCode\nlayout &lt;- layout_with_kk(g)\n\n\nSome layout algorithms take additional arguments; e.g., when laying out a graph as a tree, it might make sense to specify which vertex is to be placed at the root of the layout:\n\n\nCode\nlayout &lt;- layout_as_tree(g, root = 2)\n\n\n\n\nDrawing a graph using a layout\nWe can plot our imaginary social network with the Kamada-Kawai layout algorithm as follows:\n\n\nCode\nlayout &lt;- layout_with_kk(g)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot(g, layout = layout, main = \"Social network with the Kamada-Kawai layout algorithm\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThis should open a new window showing a visual representation of the network. Remember that the exact placement of nodes may be different on your machine since the layout is not deterministic.\nThe layout argument also accepts functions; in this case, the function will be called with the graph as its first argument. This makes it possible to just pass the name of a layout function directly, without creating a layout variable:\n\n\nCode\nplot(g, layout = layout_with_fr,\n     main = \"Social network with the Fruchterman-Reingold layout algorithm\")\n\n\n\n\n\nTo improve the visuals, a trivial addition would be to color the vertices according to the gender. We should also try to place the labels slightly outside the vertices to improve readability:\n\n\nCode\nV(g)$color &lt;- ifelse(V(g)$gender == \"m\", \"yellow\", \"red\")\nplot(g, layout = layout, vertex.label.dist = 3.5,\n     main = \"Social network - with genders as colors\")\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also treat the gender attribute as a factor and provide the colors with an argument to plot(), which takes precedence over the color vertex attribute. Colors will be assigned automatically to levels of a factor:\n\n\nCode\nplot(g, layout=layout, vertex.label.dist=3.5, vertex.color=as.factor(V(g)$gender))\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen above with the vertex.color argument, you can specify visual properties as arguments to plot instead of using vertex or edge attributes. The following plot shows the formal ties with thick lines while informal ones with thin lines:\n\n\nCode\nplot(g, layout=layout, vertex.label.dist=3.5, vertex.size=20,\n     vertex.color=ifelse(V(g)$gender == \"m\", \"yellow\", \"red\"),\n     edge.width=ifelse(E(g)$is_formal, 5, 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nThis latter approach is preferred if you want to keep the properties of the visual representation of your graph separate from the graph itself.\nIn summary, there are special vertex and edge properties that correspond to the visual representation of the graph. These attributes override the default settings of igraph (i.e color, weight, name, shape,layout,etc.). The following two tables summarise the most frequently used visual attributes for vertices and edges, respectively:\n\n\nVertex attributes controlling graph plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute name\nKeyword argument\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\ncolor\nvertex.color\nColor of the vertex\n\n\nlabel\nvertex.label\nLabel of the vertex. They will be converted to character. Specify NA to omit vertex labels. The default vertex labels are the vertex ids.\n\n\nlabel.cex\nvertex.label.cex\nFont size of the vertex label, interpreted as a multiplicative factor, similarly to R’s text function\n\n\nlabel.color\nvertex.label.color\nColor of the vertex label\n\n\nlabel.degree\nvertex.label.degree\nIt defines the position of the vertex labels, relative to the center of the vertices. It is interpreted as an angle in radian, zero means ‘to the right’, and ‘pi’ means to the left, up is -pi/2 and down is pi/2. The default value is -pi/4\n\n\nlabel.dist\nvertex.label.dist\nDistance of the vertex label from the vertex itself, relative to the vertex size\n\n\nlabel.family\nvertex.label.family\nFont family of the vertex, similarly to R’s text function\n\n\nlabel.font\nvertex.label.font\nFont within the font family of the vertex, similarly to R’s text function\n\n\nshape\nvertex.shape\nThe shape of the vertex, currently “circle”, “square”, “csquare”, “rectangle”, “crectangle”, “vrectangle”, “pie” (see vertex.shape.pie), ‘sphere’, and “none” are supported, and only by the plot.igraph command.\n\n\nsize\nvertex.size\nThe size of the vertex, a numeric scalar or vector, in the latter case each vertex sizes may differ\n\n\n\n\n\nEdge attributes controlling graph plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute name\nKeyword argument\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\ncolor\nedge.color\nColor of the edge\n\n\ncurved\nedge.curved\nA numeric value specifies the curvature of the edge; zero curvature means straight edges, negative values means the edge bends clockwise, positive values the opposite. TRUE means curvature 0.5, FALSE means curvature zero\n\n\narrow.size\nedge.arrow.size\nCurrently this is a constant, so it is the same for every edge. If a vector is submitted then only the first element is used, ie. if this is taken from an edge attribute then only the attribute of the first edge is used for all arrows.\n\n\narrow.width\nedge.arrow.width\nThe width of the arrows.

One of your good friends, Cassandra Canuck, is an Assistant General Manager for the Vancouver Canucks, a team in the National Hockey League with a long, long…. long history of futility.\nThis season feels different.\nThe Canucks are currently among the league leaders and appear to be on their way to their first playoff appearance in many years. A few weeks ago, the Vancouver Canucks decided to trade an underperforming player with a high upside and their first round draft pick to the Calgary Flames for Elias Lindholm, a very solid forward that might prove to be the missing piece of their Stanley Cup puzzle. Exciting!\nExcept that now the Canucks are struggling. They’ve lost 4 straight games and have seemingly lost their identity as a team. The fans are questioning whether the trade was worth it. Woe is me!\nFor the purposes of this exercise, let’s set the 2024 NHL draft order using the Tankathon Simulator. The NHL uses a lottery system in which the teams lowest in the standings have the highest odds of getting the first overall pick. This year the Canucks are at the top of the league, and positioned to have the 31st overall pick. According to the simulator, Calgary will pick at number 2 (which is very valuable!), and the Canuck’s pick at 31.\nHere is a screenshot:\n\n\nHere is the question:\nWas the trade worth it? This trade has a high likelihood of becoming what we call a rental. Elias Lindholm is on an expiring contract, meaning Vancouver is guaranteed to hold his contract only through the end of the season. They might be able to extend him, but that depends on the salary cap.\nMeanwhile, Calgary can draft a player at position 31, who may or may not turn out to be of equal or greater value than Lindholm.\nWas the trade worth it? Did Vancouver or Calgary “win” the trade?\nCan we make some visualizations that help us answer this question?"

I set up the original data frame to conform to the tidy data principles (every column is a variable, every row is an observation), which is pretty much the base form of how we’ve discussed Tabular Data in class.\nI’ve snuck in some functions that have allowed me to FILTER, GROUP, and SUMMARIZE the data, often creating new dataframes as I do so. Hey, look! A handy cheatsheet for data transformation using the tidyverse!\nThese functions come from the dplyr package that gets installed as part of the tidyverse. The basic categories of actions are:\n\nmutate() adds new variables that are functions of existing variables\nselect() picks variables based on their names.\nfilter() picks cases based on their values.\nsummarise() reduces multiple values down to a single summary.\narrange() changes the ordering of the rows.\n\nAll of these work with group_by() so you can perform whichever operation on the groups that might be present in your data set.\nLet’s get back to improving our understanding of the relative value of NHL draft picks. The figure above considers a single draft class (2018), and shows the total number of NHL games all the players have accumulated, separating each draft round on an ordinal x axis.\nFine, I guess, but we still have to deal with overplotting, and think about whether a scatterplot really helps us accomplish our task.

Scatterplots are great, but they work best for two quantitative attributes, and we have a situation with one or two keys and one quantitative attribute. The thing is, scatterplots can be very useful when part of our workflow involves modeling the data in some way. We’ll cover this kind of thing in future assignments, but just a bit of foreshadowing here:\n\n\nCode\nggplot(drafttot2018, aes(x=round, y=totgames))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth()\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding the smoothed line doesn’t eliminate the overplotting problem, but it does indicate that it exists. We’ll cover other potential solutions (such as box plots and violin plots) to this issue later in the course, when we get to the notions of faceting and data reduction.\nWhy not include all the data? A scatter plot with that many players (4775) isn’t going to be great. But we could plot some sort of polynomial model to get a sense of the relationship between draft position and NHL games. We’ll filter to the first 8 years of their career.\n\n\nCode\ndrafttot&lt;- NHLDraft%&gt;%\n  filter(postdraft&lt;8)%&gt;%\n  group_by(playerId, round, overall, position, name)%&gt;%\n  summarise(totgames=sum(NHLgames))\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'playerId', 'round', 'overall', 'position'.\nYou can override using the `.groups` argument.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(drafttot, aes(x=overall, y=totgames))+\n  geom_smooth()\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n\n\n\n\n\nOr we could visualize the average number of games played as a function of time since being drafted.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(NHLDraft, aes(x=postdraft, y=NHLgames))+\n  geom_smooth(aes(color=as.factor(round)))\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'"

What might picks in the range of pick 31 conceivably yield? How often do picks in that range yield players of Elias Lindholm’s value?\nI guess we’d better figure out what Elias Lindholm brings to the table.\nCan you find him in our existing data? Can you think of a way to highlight him in the context of number of games played? What other kinds of data might we need to fairly evaluate Lindholm and pick 31?\nYou will be surprised how these seemingly simple questions force you to explore the nuances of working with and visualizing tabular data."
