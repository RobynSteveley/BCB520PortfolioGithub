# Preamble

This post compares the University of Idaho grant awards from the department of agriculture (USDA), the department of energy (DOE), the national institute of health (NIH), and the national science foundation (NSF) to other similar universities.

# The Data

```{r}
#| output: false
library(tidyverse)

library(knitr)
library(scales)
```

**Department of Agriculture (USDA)**

This is the data set from the USDA. link here:

```{r}
#USDA data (each school in different file)

#reading in the data from the files
USDAdata_UI <- read.csv("USDAtoUI.csv")  #University of Idaho

#combining all schools into one dataframe
USDAdata_all <- rbind(USDAdata_UI, USDAdata_BSU, USDAdata_ISU, USDAdata_MSU, USDAdata_UM, USDAdata_WSU)

#picking out the columns that might be useful
USDA_data_main <- USDAdata_all %>% select(Award.Date, Grant.Title, Grantee.Name, Award.Dollars, Program.Name, Program.Area.Name)

#adding column: Source: USDA
USDA_data_main$Source <- 'USDA'

#rename columns
colnames(USDA_data_main) <- c('Award Date', 'Grant Title', 'Institution', 'Award Amount', 'Program Name', 'Program Area Name', 'Source')


#show table
knitr::kable(head(USDA_data_main, 4))
```

**Department of Energy (DOE)**

```{r}
#DOE data (for all schools)

#reading in data from file
suppressMessages(DOE_data <- read_xlsx("DOEawards.xlsx"))

#vector so i can pick out out only relevant schools
schools <- c('Regents of the University of Idaho', 'University of Montana', 'Washington State University', 'Boise State University', 'Idaho State University', 'Montana State University')

#picking out the columns that might be useful
DOE_data_main <- DOE_data %>% 
  filter(Institution %in% schools) %>%

**The Combined Data**

```{r}

```

# Question 1

In this section we'll look at the following question:

Provide a visualization that shows our active awards from each sponsor. I need to see their start date and end date, the amount of the award, and the name of the Principal Investigator. Iâ€™m really interested in seeing how far into the future our current portfolio will exist. Are there a bunch of awards about to expire? Are there a bunch that just got funded and will be active for a while? Does this vary across sponsors?

**The USDA awards for University of Idaho**

```{r}
#Overview of award amount per agency for active awards

#filtering the data 
#note for the USDA I'm only using grants that are dated in 2024
try({
#USDA_data_main$'Award Date' <- as.Date(USDA_data_main$'Award Date')

Question_1_1_USDA <- USDA_data_main %>%
  filter(grepl("UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO", Institution)) %>%
  filter('Award Date' > 2023-01-01) %>%
  select('Award Amount', 'Source', 'Institution', 'Award Date')

colnames(Question_1_1_USDA) <- c("Amount", "Source", "Institution", "Date")

Question_1_1_DOE <- DOE_data_main %>%
  filter(grepl("UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO", Institution)) %>%
  filter(Status == "Active") %>%
  select('Amount Awarded this FY', 'Source', 'Institution', 'End Date')

colnames(Question_1_1_DOE) <- c("Amount", "Source", "Institution", "Date")

Question_1_1_NIH <- NIH_data_main %>%
  filter(grepl("UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO", Institution)) %>%
  filter(Status == TRUE) %>%
  select('Award Amount', 'Source', 'Institution', 'End Date')

colnames(Question_1_1_NIH) <- c("Amount", "Source", "Institution", "Date")

Question_1_1_NSF <- NSF_data_main %>%
  filter(Institution == "Regents of the University of Idaho") %>%
  filter('End Date' >= 05/30/2024) %>%
  select('Estimated Total Amount', 'Source', 'Institution', "End Date")

colnames(Question_1_1_NSF) <- c("Amount", "Source", "Institution", "Date")

Question_1_1 <- rbind(Question_1_1_USDA, Question_1_1_DOE, Question_1_1_NIH, Question_1_1_NSF)
}, silent = FALSE)

################  Making the Graph  ################

# sum award money
Question_1_1$Amount <- as.numeric(Question_1_1$Amount)

Award_money_by_source <- Question_1_1 %>%
  group_by(Source) %>%
  summarise(TotalAmount = sum(Amount))

# Create bar graph
ggplot(Award_money_by_source, aes(x = Source, y = TotalAmount / 1e6, fill = Source)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Total Award Money per Agency for Active Awards",
       x = "Agency",
       y = "Total Award Money (million)") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(TotalAmount/1e6, digits = 1), vjust = -0.5)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Figure 1.** This graph shows a comparison of total award money for active awards per agency. Note that for NSF, NIH, and DOE awards were considered active if they were labeled as such and for the USDA any award with an award date after April 1st 2023 was considered active.

(or at least that will be what this graph is when i figure out how to actually make the filter by dates work... )

```{r}
#Gantt graph to look at PIs

# a graph showing pi on vertical axis sorted by amount awarded (highest amount top), with bars representing start and end dates, color coded based on source (NIH, NSF, DOE, or USDA). and set up with a fixed size and bar spacing with a scroll bar for readability if possible. Note: I should only show active so filter by that. Note: USDA will not be able to be included because of lack of start and end dates/ is active tag.

# NIH awards

#Q_1_2_NIH <- NIH_data_main

#Q_1_2_NIH$'Start Date' <- as.Date(Q_1_2_NIH$'Start Date', format = "%Y-%m-%d")
#Q_1_2_NIH$'End Date' <- as.Date(Q_1_2_NIH$'End Date', format = "%Y-%m-%d")


#ggplot(Q_1_2_NIH, aes(y = PI, x = 'Start Date', xend = 'End Date', yend = PI)) +
  #geom_segment(linewidth = 4, color = "violet") +
  #scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year", date_labels = "%Y") +
  #labs(title = "NIH Active Awards Timeline for PI",
      # x = "Year",
      # y = "Principal Investigator") +
  #theme_minimal()
  
  
```

```{r}
# NSF awards
#same as above

# DOE awards
#same as above
# don't need this one simce no active awards

```

## Question 2

What is the proportional representation of new awards to the UI from these various sources over the past 5 to 10 years? Are there any trends that are encouraging or discouraging?

```{r}
#Trends over time

# a graph showing the number of new awards from each source (or just awards in the case of USDA) vs time, with a different line for each source.
# a graph showing the amount of money per new awards vs. time for each source.


#Question_2_1 <- 
#ggplot

```

## Comparing the Schools

```{r}

# a graph showing a comparison of awards (or award money) given to each school by source. so a clump showing the number of awards (or amount of money) from for example from the NSF for each school then another clump for NIH, etc. Color coded by school for visibility across clumps. Note: active awards only. For the USDA awards use date = 2024

# need to organize data so that the different versions of the schools are all sorted together. so things are grouped based on if each school name is grouped together. I also may need to worry about dates in the different groups, although i do think i need to work with the dates in the above section convert dates 

suppressMessages({

Q3_1_1 <- combined_data %>%
  filter(Source %in% c("NIH", "NSF", "USDA", "DOE")) %>%
  #filter(by the date!!!!) %>%
  mutate(category = case_when(
      grepl("University of Idaho", Institution, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "University of Idaho",
      grepl("Boise State University", Institution, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Boise State University",
      grepl("Idaho State University", Institution, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Idaho State University",
      grepl("Montana State University", Institution, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Montana State University",
      grepl("University of Montana", Institution, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "University of Montana",
      grepl("Washington State University", Institution, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Washington State University",
      #TRUE ~ "Other"
      )
  ) %>%
  group_by(category, Source) %>%
    summarise(awards_count = n())
})


institution_colors <- c("University of Idaho" = "gold", "Boise State University" = "salmon", "Idaho State University" = "skyblue", "Montana State University" = "forestgreen",  "University of Montana" = "violet",  "Washington State University" = "brown")


ggplot(Q3_1_1, aes(x = Source, y = awards_count, fill = category)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = institution_colors, name = "Institution") +
  labs(title = "Number of Awards Per School (Over All Dates)",
       x = "",
       y = "Number of Awards") +
    theme_minimal()
  
```

**Figure ?.** Comparing the number of awards for each school across the whole data set

```{r}
#comparing the schools to each other

# a graph comparing trends for each school (are any downturns coming for all the schools?). color coded and shape coded to clump schools, and sources. Colors for schools, shapes for sources, e.g. solid lines for NSF, rect dash for NIH, triangles dash for DOE, dots dash for USDA.
